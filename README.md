# CateringSystem
A management system developed to automate CRUD operations in a catering database along with validations and billing to take in and close orders appropriately

Manual management can become difficult when it comes to maintaining concurrent processes as in catering System. This project is developed to automate the process of data manipulation so as to insert, delete , search and update customer data by means of computer programs.
User data is inserted into the databse until the order is served and closed. The entry is deleted if and only if the bill is settled with sufficient amount. The bill is generated for customer purpose. The manager/customer can also search to keep track of oneâ€™s order. The system is flexible to allow to user to details and orders without affecting the functioning of the program. A new bill is also updated and generated for the same.

Front End: Jframe (GUI)
Back End: Java Netbeans 
Data Management : MYSQL Workbench
